## Welcome to CS183B

I am Sam Altman, I'm the President of Y Combinator. Nine years ago, I was a Stanford student, and then I dropped out to start a company and then I've been an investor for the last few. So YC, we've been teaching people how to start startups for nine years. Most of it's pretty specific to the startups but thirty percent of it is pretty generally applicable. And so we think we can teach that thirty percent in this class. And even though that's only thirty percent of the way there, hopefully it will still be really helpful.
