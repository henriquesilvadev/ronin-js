## Assignment 2: Consensus from trust

For this assignment, you will design and implement a distributed consensus algorithm given a graph of “trust” relationships between nodes. This is an alternative method of resisting sybil attacks and achieving consensus; it has the benefit of not “wasting” electricity like proof-of-work does.

Nodes in the network are either compliant or malicious. You will write a CompliantNode class (which implements a provided Node interface) that defines the behavior of each of the compliant nodes. The network is a directed random graph, where each edge represents a trust relationship. For example, if there is an A → B edge, it means that Node B listens to transactions broadcast by node A. We say that B is A’s follower and A is B’s followee.

The provided Node class has the following API:

```java
public interface Node {
  // NOTE: Node is an interface and does not have a constructor.
  // However, your CompliantNode.java class requires a 4 argument
  // constructor as defined in the provided CompliantNode.java.
  // This constructor gives your node information about the simulation
  // including the number of rounds it will run for.

  /** {@code followees[i]} is true if this node follows node {@code i} */
  void setFollowees ( boolean [] followees);

  /** initialize proposal list of transactions */
  void setPendingTransaction ( Set<Transaction> pendingTransactions);

  /**
  * @return proposals to send to my followers. REMEMBER: After final round,
  * behavior of { @code getProposals} changes and it should return the
  * transactions upon which consensus has been reached.
  */
  Set<Transaction> sendToFollowers ();
  
  /** receive candidates from other nodes. */
  void receiveFromFollowees ( Set<Candidate> candidates);
}
```
